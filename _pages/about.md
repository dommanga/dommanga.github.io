intro: |
  Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm a senior studying Computer Science and Engineering with a deep passion for human life and society. I envision a world where every individual can freely pursue their own path, and I'm continuously exploring how I can contribute to this vision through computer science and technology. Feel free to explore my website!
