intro: |
  Hi! I’m a 1st year PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/csepostech/index.do#none) at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng). I'm working with [Prof. Eunkyung Jo](https://eunkyungjo.com/) in the [Health and Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://dommanga.github.io/).

  I believe in a world where everyone is free to be themselves, to dream boldly, and to be celebrated for their uniqueness. My journey in computer science is about exploring how technology can support that vision.
