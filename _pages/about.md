intro: |
  Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a senior in Computer Science and Engineering, passionate about diversity and individuality.
  I believe in a world where everyone is free to be themselves, to dream boldly, and to be celebrated for their uniqueness. My journey in computer science is about exploring how technology can support that vision.
  Welcome to my siteâ€”Iâ€™d love for you to look around!
