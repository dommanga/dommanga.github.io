intro: |
  Hi! I am a 1st year PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.postech.ac.kr/csepostech/index.do#none) at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr/eng). I'm working with [Prof. Eunkyung Jo](https://eunkyungjo.com/) in the [Health and Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://dommanga.github.io/).

  I'm interested in how technology can make human experiences richer and more expressive. I believe good design should feel human.

    project: "Enhancing Dance Appreciation through Haptic Feedback of Music Stems"
    technologies: ["Spleeter", "Python", "Tactile Transducer"]
    description: "Developed a haptic system using tactile transducers to convey dance movements through vibration. Explored optimal mappings between separated music stems and tactile feedback through a user study."

  - name: "Research Project II"
    role: ""
    date: "Sep 2025 - Dec 2025"
    project: "Effects of Non-verbal Empathy Expressions by AI Peer Counseling Avatars on User Responses"
    technologies: ["Three.js", "ARKit BlendShapes", "JavaScript"]
    description: "Implemented an AI Avatar Peer Counselor system using facial animation techniques (FACS-based) that generates real-time non-verbal empathy expressions based on users' speech. This HCI research aims to verify the effects of non-verbal empathy expressions by AI avatars and explore effective strategies."
